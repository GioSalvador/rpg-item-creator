𝔟𝔶: 𝔊𝔦𝔬𝔳𝔞𝔫𝔦 𝔖𝔞𝔩𝔳𝔞𝔡𝔬𝔯

**RPG Item Creator** is a frontend application built with Next.js and Tailwind, intended to allow users to design and generate items for RPG contexts via a user-friendly interface.  

➡️ [Live Demo](https://rpg-item-creator.vercel.app/) *(Deployed via Vercel)*

## Features

- Item creation UI: define name, image, stats, value, etc.  
- Instant preview and editing capabilities.  
- Responsive front-end design (via Tailwind CSS)  
- Strong TypeScript support.

## Getting Started (Local Setup)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm / yarn / pnpm (choose your preferred package manager)  
- Git (for cloning the repository)

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/GioSalvador/weather-app.git](https://github.com/GioSalvador/rpg-item-creator.git)
   cd rpg-item-creator
   
2. Install dependencies: 
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or

3. Start the development server:

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

## Usage

Once the server is running, use the UI to:
- Fill in the item fields: name, type, rarity, stats, image, etc.
- Preview the item display immediately.

## Tips
On your computer, hover your cursor over the item's card to see an interesting animation.

## Future Enhancements

- Create a download bottom to download the Item Card.
